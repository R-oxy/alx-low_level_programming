# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

In this project, I will explore the world of search algorithms in the C programming language. I will dive into the concepts of search algorithms, including linear search and binary search, and understand how to choose the best search algorithm based on specific needs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without the need for external resources:

### What is a Search Algorithm?

A search algorithm is a step-by-step process used to locate specific data within a larger dataset. Search algorithms are essential in computer science and are widely employed in various applications, from searching for a word in a document to finding an element in a data structure.

### What is a Linear Search?

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that iterates through a dataset one element at a time to find a specific target. It's efficient for small datasets but less efficient for large datasets as the time required grows linearly with the dataset size.

### What is a Binary Search?

Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted datasets. It repeatedly divides the dataset in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements with each comparison. This process continues until the target is found or identified as absent. Binary search is highly efficient for large datasets and has a time complexity of O(log n).

### Choosing the Best Search Algorithm

Selecting the most appropriate search algorithm depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset. Linear search is suitable for unsorted data, while binary search excels with sorted data. The choice of algorithm should consider factors such as dataset size, data organization, and time constraints.

Through this project, I will gain a solid understanding of these fundamental search algorithms, their implementation in C, and the ability to make informed decisions about which algorithm is best suited for different scenarios.

This project will equip me with essential knowledge and skills in algorithmic thinking, data searching, and the optimization of search processes, all of which are fundamental in the field of computer science.
