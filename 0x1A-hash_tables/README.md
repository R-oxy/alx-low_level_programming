# Hash Tables - Learning Objectives

In this project, I learned about hash tables and their applications. Here are the key concepts I grasped without relying on external resources:

- Understanding the concept of a hash function and its purpose in hash tables.
- Identifying the characteristics of a good hash function, such as uniform distribution and minimal collisions.
- Grasping the definition and inner workings of a hash table, including how to store and retrieve data using keys.
- Recognizing collisions in hash tables and exploring the main collision resolution techniques, such as chaining and open addressing.
- Assessing the advantages of using hash tables, such as efficient data retrieval and storage.
- Evaluating the drawbacks of hash tables, such as increased memory usage and potential performance degradation in the presence of collisions.
- Identifying common use cases where hash tables provide effective solutions, such as implementing caches, symbol tables, and data indexing.

Through this project, I developed a solid understanding of hash tables and their practical applications.
