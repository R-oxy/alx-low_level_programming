# 0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

In this project, I will be exploring the concept and implementation of doubly linked lists in the C programming language. By the end of this project, I aim to gain a deep understanding of doubly linked lists and how to effectively utilize them in my code.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, I will focus on achieving the following learning objectives:

- Understand the fundamental concept of a doubly linked list and how it differs from a singly linked list.
- Learn how to work with doubly linked lists, including adding, deleting, and traversing nodes.
- Familiarize myself with the operations and manipulations commonly performed on doubly linked lists.
- Gain proficiency in dynamically allocating and freeing memory using `malloc` and `free`.
- Sharpen my ability to read and comprehend code specifications and requirements.
- Develop the skill to seek and find relevant resources for learning and problem-solving, reducing my reliance on external help and search engines.

## Resources

I will actively challenge myself by attempting to solve problems and grasp concepts independently. This approach will strengthen my knowledge, improve my problem-solving skills, and enhance my ability to find the right information.
