# Learning Objectives - C Makefiles

In this project, I gained a solid understanding of Makefiles and their significance in the world of programming. By the end of this project, I can confidently explain the following concepts to others without the need for external references:

## General Understanding

- **Make and Makefiles:** I understand the purpose and functionality of Make and Makefiles in the context of building and managing software projects.

- **Usage of Makefiles:** I know when, why, and how to use Makefiles to streamline the compilation and build process of software projects.

## Rules and Targets

- **Rules in Makefiles:** I can define and utilize rules in Makefiles to specify how source code files should be compiled and linked.

- **Setting Targets:** I understand the concept of targets in Makefiles and how they represent the goals of the build process.

## Explicit and Implicit Rules

- **Explicit Rules:** I can create explicit rules in Makefiles to specify how to build specific target files from their corresponding source files.

- **Implicit Rules:** I understand the concept of implicit rules and how they help automate the build process for files with known extensions.

## Common and Useful Rules

- **Common Rules:** I know some of the most common and useful rules used in Makefiles, such as `all`, `clean`, and `re`.

## Variables in Makefiles

- **Variables Definition:** I can define and use variables in Makefiles to store and manage values that are reused throughout the build process.

- **Variable Usage:** I understand how to use variables to simplify and customize build commands and paths in Makefiles.

Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience with Makefiles, learned how to create efficient build processes, and acquired the skills to manage larger software projects more effectively.
